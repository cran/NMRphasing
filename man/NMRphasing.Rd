\usage{
NMRphasing(
  specDatIn,
  absorptionOnly = FALSE,
  method = c("NLS", "MPC_DANM", "MPC_EMP", "MPC_AAM", "MPC_DSM", "SPC_DANM", "SPC_EMP",
    "SPC_AAM", "SPC_DSM"),
  withBC = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{specDatIn}{Input spectrum data, which can be one of the four formats:
a vector of absorption spectrum; a complex vector; a data matrix or a data frame with two columns of spectrum data,
which 1st column is for absorption spectrum, and 2nd column is for dispersion spectrum}

\item{absorptionOnly}{A logical variable to tell us if specDatIn is a a vector of absorption specrtrum, default is false}

\item{method}{One of phase correction and baseline correction methods. There are nine available choices, which are "NLS", "MPC_DAOM", "MPC_EMP", "MPC_AAM", "MPC_DSM", "SPC_DAOM", "SPC_EMP", "SPC_AAM", "SPC_DSM",
with "NLS", non-linear shrinkage as default.}

\item{withBC}{A logical parameter that enables/disables baseline correction after baseline correction}
}
\value{
A numeric vector of phase corrected absorption spectrum
}
\description{
Phase error correction wrap up function
}
\details{
This is a wrap function to process phase error correction and baseline correction with nine different choices.
}
\examples{
data("fdat")
nls_phased <- NMRphasing(specDatIn = fdat$frequency_domain, method = "NLS")
